# Shopping-Menu
A shopping menu cart made using python (OOP based) Command line project. This project basically has two interfaces that are Admin panel and second is User panel. Admin panel has a security check that anyone wants to perform CRUD operation on the items of shop they have to enter the password set by admin via username . If we take a look at the User side , there's a registration form that keeps the record of user that whether this is shop's old user or new one so that they can be in a touch with admin side . Same the  user can also perform the CRUD operation on the selected items of his/her choice , and can view the updated list anytime by running the appropriate function and can finally have billing printing process as well .
